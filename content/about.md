My name is Jacob Alzén and I'm an open source advocate and developer, amateur photographer, and long distance trail runner from Sweden. I'm currently studying my third year of Computer Science and Engineering  at Linköping University, Sweden.

I've been active within open source communities for many years.
Before learning software development, I was working on community moderation, release testing and translation for the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser project. 
I have since moved on to being an active developer within various other open source projects. Some of the programming languages that I work with on a regular basis are Go, Python and C++.

You will find many of my open source projects, and more information about them, over on the [projects](/projects) page. Most notably, ai am a member of the team of core developers working on [Fyne](https://fyne.io). My most popular project is [Rymdport](https://rymdport.github.io) at the moment.
