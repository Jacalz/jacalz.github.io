My name is Jacob Alzén and I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at Linköping University, Sweden.
I'm a long time open source advocate and developer, amateur photographer, and long distance trail runner.

I have been active within open source communities for many years at this point.
Before learning software development, I was working on community moderation, release testing and translation for the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser project. 
I have since moved on to being an active developer within various open source projects.

You will find many of my open source projects, and more information about them, over on the [projects](/projects) page.
Currently, one of which is being a member of the team of core developers working on [Fyne](https://fyne.io).
